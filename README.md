# Flappy Bird with Convex Hull and Quad Tree
This project is a simple Flappy Bird-style game enhanced with computational geometry algorithms, including:

## Convex Hull (Graham's scan)

## Quad Tree

It demonstrates how data structures and algorithms can be applied in real-time games for collision detection and efficient spatial data management.

## Technologies & Algorithms Used

Graham Scan for convex hull detection

Custom Quad Tree implementation for point cloud management

2D collision detection based on convex polygon intersections
